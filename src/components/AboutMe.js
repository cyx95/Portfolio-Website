      <p>
        I am a software engineer and a recent graduate of The GraceHopper
        Program at Fullstack Academy. Prior to becoming a software engineer, I
        worked in the hospitality industry as a waitress and food runner for 6+
        years.

        I've always had a profound interest in creating new things from scratch.
        I've always wondered how games were programed and how websites
        functionality worked. I finally saw my opportunity to pursue my
        interests when the pandemic hit. Jumping into this new chapter of my
        life was thrilling and exciting. I love being able to explore my
        creativity and build new applications from scratch.
      </p>

        Iâ€™m looking forward to exploring full stack roles where I can be part of
        a small team with lots of mentorship, and help build web applications
        that people can utilize and benefit from. My main skills include
        Javascript, React, Redux, Express, Sequelize, HTML, and CSS. I have a
        basic knowledge in Three.js and Kaboom.js.
